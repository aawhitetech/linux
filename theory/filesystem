@FILESYSTEM

- A file system is a logical collection of files on a partition or disk. A partition is a container for information and can span an entire hard drive if desired.
- Your hard drive can have various partitions which usually contains only one file system, such as one file system housing the / file system or another containing the /home file system.
- One file system per partition allows for the logical maintenance and management of differing file systems.
- Everything in Linux is considered to be a file, including physical devices such as DVD-ROMs, USB devices, floppy drives, and so forth.
- Directory Structure:
    Linux uses a hierarchical file system structure, much like an upside-down tree, with root (/) at the base of the file system and all other directories spreading from there.
- A LINUX filesystem is a collection of files and directories that has the following properties:
- It has a root directory (/) that contains other files and directories.
- Each file or directory is uniquely identified by its name, the directory in which it resides, and a unique identifier, typically called an inode.
- By convention, the root directory has an inode number of 2 and the lost+found directory has an inode number of 3. Inode numbers 0 and 1 are not used. File inode numbers can be seen by specifying the -i option to ls command.
- It is self contained. There are no dependencies between one filesystem and any other.

Filesystem Types
- ext3 (Linux)
- ext4 (Linux)
- xfs (Linux)
- NTFS (Windows)
- FAT (Windows)

Structure

- /bin -> /usr/bin   - User Binaries - Everyday user commands
- /boot              - Boot Loader files - Contains file that is used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
- /dev               - Device Filse - System Devices (e.g. disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, etc.)
- /etc               - Configuration files
- /home              - Home Directories - Directory for user
- /lib -> /usr/lib   - System Libraries - C programming library files needed by commands and apps
- /media             - Removable Devices - For cdrom mounts
- /mnt               - Mount Direcory - To mount external filesystem (e.g. NFS)
- /opt               - Optional Add-on Apps - Optional add-on applications (Not part of OS apps)
- /proc              - Process information - Running processes (Only exist in Memory)
- /root              - Root user home directory. It is not same as /
- /run               - System daemons that start very early (e.g. systemd and udev) to store temporary runtime files like PID files
- /sbin -> /usr/sbin - System Binaries - System/filesystem commands
- /srv               - Service Data
- /tmp               - Temporary files - Directory for temporary files
- /var               - Variable files - Contains files that change - log files, spool dirs, formatted manual pages, temporary files
- /usr               - User Programs - contains commands, libraries, manual pages, and other unchanging files needed for normal operation (Not machine specific)
