### 1. **Physical Connection Check**:
- Ensure all cables (Ethernet, etc.) are properly connected.
- Check that devices (routers, modems, switches) are powered on and indicating normal status through LED lights.

### 2. **Interface Check**:
- List all network interfaces with:
  ```bash
  ip a
  ```
- Ensure your interface is UP. If not, you can bring it up using:
  ```bash
  sudo ip link set [interface-name] up
  ```

### 3. **IP Configuration Check**:
- Confirm that your interface has an IP address. If not, you might need to configure it manually or ensure a DHCP server is reachable.
- If you need to set a static IP:
  ```bash
  sudo ip addr add [IP-Address]/[CIDR] dev [interface-name]
  ```

### 4. **Ping Test**:
- Test local network stack:
  ```bash
  ping 127.0.0.1
  ```
- Test local network:
  ```bash
  ping [local-router-IP]
  ```

- Test an external IP to see if you can reach the outside world:
  ```bash
  ping 8.8.8.8
  ```

- Test domain name resolution:
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```

### 5. **DNS Configuration Check**:
- Check `/etc/resolv.conf` for DNS servers:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/resolv.conf
  ```
- If necessary, manually set a DNS server. Google's public DNS is `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`, and Cloudflare's is `1.1.1.1`.

### 6. **Routing Check**:
- Check your routing table with:
  ```bash
  ip route
  ```
- Ensure there's a default route configured. If not, add one:
  ```bash
  sudo ip route add default via [router-IP]
  ```

### 7. **Network Service Check**:
- If using NetworkManager or `systemd-networkd`, ensure the service is running:
  ```bash
  systemctl status NetworkManager
  # OR
  systemctl status systemd-networkd
  ```

### 8. **Firewall/Security Rules**:
- Check if a firewall is blocking your connections:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -L -v
  ```
- For systems using `firewalld`:
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
  ```

### 9. **Network Tools**:
- **`netstat`**: View network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
- **`ss`**: Another utility to investigate sockets.
- **`traceroute`** (or `mtr`): Show the route packets take to reach a network host.
- **`nmap`**: Scan open ports on a machine.
- **`nslookup`** and **`dig`**: Query DNS lookup name.

### 10. **Check for External Issues**:
Sometimes the problem isn't on your end. It could be an issue with your ISP, a downed service you're trying to reach, or routing issues beyond your local network.

### 11. **Check Logs**:
- System logs can provide information about network-related issues. On systems with `systemd`, you can use:
  ```bash
  journalctl -xe
  ```
- Check logs for NetworkManager, if in use:
  ```bash
  journalctl -u NetworkManager
  ```

### 12. **Restart Services/Reboot**:
Sometimes simply restarting networking services or the whole system can help:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
# OR
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```
If all else fails, a system reboot might be helpful.
