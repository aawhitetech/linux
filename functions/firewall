### 1. **Check the `firewalld` Service Status**:

Before troubleshooting, ensure `firewalld` is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```

If it's not running, start it with:
```bash
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```

### 2. **List Active Zones and Interfaces**:

This will display the active zones and associated interfaces:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```

### 3. **List All Rules in the Active Zone**:

This is useful to see the rules that are applied in the current active zone:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

### 4. **List Rules in a Specific Zone**:

To see rules in a particular zone, use:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
```
Replace `public` with the desired zone name.

### 5. **Querying a Service or Port**:

Check if a specific service is allowed:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --query-service=http
```

Check if a specific port is allowed:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --query-port=8080/tcp
```

### 6. **Logs and Messages**:

If `firewalld` is not behaving as expected, checking logs can provide clues:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u firewalld
```

### 7. **Check Default and Active Zones**:

The default zone is where interfaces will be placed if no zone is specified:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
```

To see the active zone:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zone
```

### 8. **Reload `firewalld` Without Dropping Connections**:

If you made temporary (`--permanent` not used) changes and want to revert them:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### 9. **List All Available Services**:

This shows all predefined services in `firewalld`:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --get-services
```

### 10. **Adding and Removing Services/Ports**:

Add a service (temporarily):
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http
```

Add a service permanently (survives reboots):
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
```

Similarly, for ports:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
```

### 11. **Direct Rules**:

For more complex rules or if you need to do something not covered by standard commands, you can use direct rules. Here's how to list them:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --direct --get-all-rules
```

### 12. **Check Panic Mode**:

In panic mode, all incoming and outgoing packets are dropped, and active connections will be terminated:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --query-panic
```

### 13. **Interfaces and Zones**:

To move an interface to a different zone:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --change-interface=eth0
```
Replace `eth0` with your interface and `public` with your desired zone.

Remember, the `--permanent` option makes the changes permanent but requires a reload (`firewall-cmd --reload`) to apply the changes to the running configuration. If `--permanent` isn't specified, the change is made to the running configuration and will be lost on the next reload or reboot.

When troubleshooting, always keep in mind the order of your rules, as the first match wins. If a deny or drop rule matches before an allow rule, the allow rule will never take effect.
