@SAMBA @FILESHARE @FILESYSTEM @NFS

- Linux utility allows sharing of linux resources (files / printers) with other OS'
- Works exactly like NFS but the difference being NFS is linux / Unix only
- Samba shares its filesystem through a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block) which was invented by IBM
- Another protocol used to share Samba is through CIFS (Common Internet File System) invented by Microsoft and also NMB (NetBios Name server)

# Setup Samba Server

# Install samba packages
yum install samba samba-client samba-common
# Enable samba to be allowed through firewall (Only if you have firewall running)
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=samba
firewall-cmd â€“reload
# To stop and disable firewall or iptables
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl stop iptables
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl disable iptables

# Create Samba share directory and assign permissions
mkdir -p /samba/morepretzels
chmod a+rwx /samba/morepretzels
chown -R nobody:nobody /samba

# Also, you need to change the SELinux security context for the samba shared directory as follows: (Only if you have SELinux enabled)
chcon -t samba_share_t /samba/morepretzels

# Modify /etc/samba/smb.conf file to add new shared filesystem (Make sure to create a copy of smb.conf file)
# Delete everything from smb.conf file and add the following parameters
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
netbios name = centos
security = user
map to guest = bad user
dns proxy = no
[Anonymous]
path = /samba/morepretzels
browsable = yes
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
guest only = yes
read only = no

# Verify the setting
testparm

# Once the packages are installed, enable and start Samba services
systemctl enable smb
systemctl enable nmb
systemctl start smb
systemctl start nmb

# Mount on Windows client
o Go to start
o Go to search bar
o Type \\<serverIp>

# Mount on Linux client
yum -y install cifs-utils samba-client

# Create a mount point directory
mkdir /mnt/sambashare
# Mount the samba share
mount -t cifs //<serverIp>/Anonymous /mnt/sambashare/
# Entry without password

# Security

# Create a group smbgrp & user larry to access the samba server with proper authentication
useradd larry
groupadd smbgrp
usermod -a -G smbgrp larry
smbpasswd -a larry
New SMB password: YOUR SAMBA PASS
Retype new SMB password: REPEAT YOUR SAMBA PASS
Added user larry
# Create a new share, set the permission on the share:
mkdir /samba/securepretzels
chown -R larry:smbgrp /samba/securepretzels
chmod -R 0770 /samba/securepretzels
chcon -t samba_share_t /samba/securepretzels
# Edit the configuration file /etc/samba/smb.conf (Create a backup copy first)
vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

# Add the following lines
[Secure]
path = /samba/securepretzels
valid users = @smbgrp
guest ok = no
writable = yes
browsable = yes
# Restart the services
systemctl restart smb
systemctl restart nmb
