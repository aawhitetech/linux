Common Options
    -i ignore case
    -c report only a count of the number of lines containing matches, not the matches themselves
    -v invert the search, displaying only lines that do not match
    -n display the line number along with the line on which a match was found

        0, for match(es) found
        1, for no matches
        2, for errors
